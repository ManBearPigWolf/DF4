This is my attempt to clone a DF3 but with changes I think are useful. In all my putters, personalization and customization are core design principles.

The biggest change is the addition of a face insert. The insert is mechanically attached, ~~unlike the insert on the OZ1i which is glued on.~~ (Turns out the OZ1i intsert is screwed in from the back) There's nothing inherently wrong with gluing on inserts, almost all putters on the market with inserts use a glued attachment; my background as an engineer has always taught me to never make something permananet that doesn't need to be.

The second notable change is that the "body" of the putter and the piece that holds the face insert are two different parts. They use 3/32" dowel pins to make a locating attachment, and M4 flat head screws behind the face insert to make the secure mechanical attachment.

Separting the two pieces makes the manufacturing a little easier, as both parts have some pretty complicated geometry. Manufacturing as one piece would be quite a bit more difficult than two pieces that can be mated together. It also allows for easier customization of colors and sight lines, as well as potentially being able to swap shafts and lie angles without getting an entirely new putter.

--------------UPDATE 7/30----------------
I recieved the prototype of the DF4 yesterday, the pieces fit together flawlessly! I still need to balance it as it's slightly toe heavy, but this is to be expected. There's tolerances in machining and the shaft probably isn't exactly at 73 degrees, after stacking all the tolerances it's not reasonable to expect it to balance in a revealer without some weighting. I've uploaded a bunch of lie angles in left and right hand models so people can fit the putter to themselves. If there's something missing, just open an issue and I'll get it resolved as quickly as possible.
